# Build a smart home automation system using OSGi 
This repo contains basic notes about how to build a smart home automation system using OSGi in order to manage various IoT devices within the home.

<br>

## Basic Steps:
### 1. Choose the IoT devices:
 First, select the IoT devices that you want to automate in your home, such as smart thermostats, smart lights, smart locks, etc. Make sure that the devices you choose are compatible with OSGi. 
 
   * To make sure that the IoT devices you choose are compatible with OSGi, you can follow these steps:

   * * ***Check the device specifications:*** <br>
   Check the specifications of the IoT devices you are interested in to see if they support OSGi. Look for information about the device's software architecture or compatibility with home automation systems.

   <br>

   * * ***Look for OSGi certifications:*** <br>
   Look for devices that have been certified as OSGi-compliant by the OSGi Alliance. The OSGi Alliance is a consortium of companies that develop and promote the OSGi framework.

   <br>

   * * ***Check for third-party plugins:*** <br>
   Check if the device has third-party plugins or add-ons that support OSGi integration. Some manufacturers may provide plugins or APIs that allow their devices to be integrated with OSGi frameworks.

<br>

### 2. Install an OSGi container: 
Next, you'll need to install an OSGi container on a server or a Raspberry Pi that will act as the hub for all the IoT devices. Apache Felix is a popular choice for OSGi containers.

<br>

### 3. Install OSGi bundles: 
Install OSGi bundles for each of the IoT devices you want to automate. OSGi bundles are modules that can be installed and uninstalled independently, allowing you to add or remove devices from the system without affecting other parts of the system.

<br>

### 4. Create an OSGi application: 
Create an OSGi application that will manage the IoT devices. The application will communicate with the OSGi bundles and control the devices.

<br>

### 5. Configure the system: 
Configure the OSGi application to communicate with each of the IoT devices. You'll need to specify the IP address, port number, and other settings for each device.

<br>

### 6. Create automation rules: 
Create automation rules that will trigger actions based on events, such as turning on the lights when someone enters a room, adjusting the thermostat based on the time of day, etc. You can use a rule engine like Drools to create these rules.

<br>

### 7. Test and refine: 
Test the system and refine it as necessary. Make sure that all the devices are working correctly and that the automation rules are triggering the desired actions.
