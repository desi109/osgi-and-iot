# Build a smart home automation system using OSGi 
This repo contains basic notes about how to build a smart home automation system using OSGi in order to manage various IoT devices within the home.

<br>

## Basic Steps:
### 1. Choose the IoT devices:
 First, select the IoT devices that you want to automate in your home, such as smart thermostats, smart lights, smart locks, etc. Make sure that the devices you choose are compatible with OSGi. 

   * There are several IoT devices that are compatible with OSGi, including:
   * * ***Philips Hue smart lighting system:*** <br>
   Philips Hue is a smart lighting system that allows users to control their lights using a mobile app or voice commands. The Hue Bridge that controls the system is based on OSGi.
   * * ***Eclipse SmartHome:***  <br>
   Eclipse SmartHome is an open-source smart home platform that is built on OSGi. It provides a framework for integrating smart home devices and building automation solutions.
   * * ***Samsung SmartThings:***  <br>
   Samsung SmartThings is a smart home platform that allows users to connect and control their smart home devices. The platform is built on OSGi and provides a range of APIs for integrating with different devices.
   * * ***Bosch IoT Suite:***  <br>
   Bosch IoT Suite is a platform for building IoT solutions that is built on OSGi. It provides a range of tools and services for managing and connecting IoT devices.
   * * ***Conrad Connect:***  <br>
   Conrad Connect is a smart home platform that allows users to connect and control their devices. The platform is built on OSGi and provides a range of APIs for integrating with different devices.

   <br>

   * To make sure that the IoT devices you choose are compatible with OSGi, you can follow these steps:
   * * ***Check the device specifications:*** <br>
   Check the specifications of the IoT devices you are interested in to see if they support OSGi. Look for information about the device's software architecture or compatibility with home automation systems.
   * * ***Look for OSGi certifications:*** <br>
   Look for devices that have been certified as OSGi-compliant by the OSGi Alliance. The OSGi Alliance is a consortium of companies that develop and promote the OSGi framework.
   * * ***Check for third-party plugins:*** <br>
   Check if the device has third-party plugins or add-ons that support OSGi integration. Some manufacturers may provide plugins or APIs that allow their devices to be integrated with OSGi frameworks.

<br>

* Or make an IoT device competible with OSGi which involves developing an OSGi bundle for the device:
* * ***Define the device functionality:*** <br> 
The first step is to define the functionality of the IoT device. This involves identifying the features and functions that the device will provide to users.
* * ***Choose the OSGi framework:*** <br>
Choose the OSGi framework that is best suited for your device. This may involve selecting a specific implementation of OSGi, such as Apache Felix or Eclipse Equinox.
* * ***Develop the OSGi bundle:*** <br> 
Develop an OSGi bundle for the device. This bundle should contain the functionality required for the device, including any APIs or services that it provides.
* * ***Implement the device drivers:*** <br> 
Implement the device drivers that will be used to interact with the hardware components of the device. This may involve developing custom drivers or using existing drivers that are compatible with OSGi.
* * ***Define the device data model:*** <br> 
Define the data model for the device. This will involve defining the data structures that will be used to store and manipulate data within the device.
* * ***Implement the device data storage:*** <br> 
Implement the data storage mechanism for the device. This can be a database or a file-based storage mechanism.
* * ***Develop the device user interface:*** <br> Develop a user interface for the device. This interface should be easy to use and provide access to all the functionality of the device.

<br>

### 2. Install an OSGi container: 
Next, you'll need to install an OSGi container on a server or a Raspberry Pi that will act as the hub for all the IoT devices. Apache Felix is a popular choice for OSGi containers.

<br>

### 3. Install OSGi bundles: 
Install OSGi bundles for each of the IoT devices you want to automate. OSGi bundles are modules that can be installed and uninstalled independently, allowing you to add or remove devices from the system without affecting other parts of the system.

<br>

### 4. Create an OSGi application: 
Create an OSGi application that will manage the IoT devices. The application will communicate with the OSGi bundles and control the devices.

<br>

### 5. Configure the system: 
Configure the OSGi application to communicate with each of the IoT devices. You'll need to specify the IP address, port number, and other settings for each device.

<br>

### 6. Create automation rules: 
Create automation rules that will trigger actions based on events, such as turning on the lights when someone enters a room, adjusting the thermostat based on the time of day, etc. You can use a rule engine like Drools to create these rules.

<br>

### 7. Test and refine: 
Test the system and refine it as necessary. Make sure that all the devices are working correctly and that the automation rules are triggering the desired actions.
