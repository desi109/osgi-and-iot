# Develop an OSGi bundle for an IoT device

Here's a basic example of how to develop an OSGi bundle for an IoT device:

<br>

1. Create a new OSGi project in your preferred IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
<br>

2. Define the bundle's manifest file, which is used to specify the bundle's metadata, including its name, version, and dependencies. In the manifest file, you'll also specify any necessary OSGi headers, such as `Bundle-Activator`, which identifies the class that should be instantiated when the bundle is started. For example, your manifest file might look like this:
```java
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
Bundle-Name: My IoT Bundle
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.example.iot.bundle
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Bundle-Activator: com.example.iot.bundle.Activator
Require-Bundle: org.osgi.core;bundle-version="1.9.0"
```
<br>

3. Define the bundle's Java code. In this example, we'll create a simple bundle that provides a service for controlling an LED on the IoT device. The service will be registered with the OSGi framework and can be used by other bundles in the environment. Here's an example `Activator` class that creates the LED service:
```java
package com.example.iot.ui.bundle;

import org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator;
import org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;
import org.osgi.framework.ServiceReference;

import com.example.iot.api.LED;

public class Activator implements BundleActivator {

    private LED led;

    public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        // Find the LED service and store a reference to it.
        ServiceReference<LED> ledRef = context.getServiceReference(LED.class);
        led = context.getService(ledRef);

        // Create the user interface and start it.
        MyUI ui = new MyUI(led);
        ui.start();
    }

    public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        // Stop the user interface and release the LED service reference.
        led = null;
    }
}
```
<br>

4. Define the interface and implementation of the LED service. In this example, we'll create a simple ***LED*** interface that provides methods for turning the ***LED*** on and off, and a `MyLED` implementation that provides the actual implementation of the service. To implement turning on and off of the LED in the `MyLED` class, you can use hardware-specific libraries or APIs to control the LED. Here's an example implementation that uses the ***Pi4J*** library to control an LED connected to a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin:
```java
package com.example.iot.bundle;

import com.example.iot.api.LED;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioController;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioFactory;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioPinDigitalOutput;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.PinState;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.RaspiPin;

public class MyLED implements LED {

    private GpioPinDigitalOutput ledPin;

    public MyLED() {
        // Initialize the GPIO controller and the LED pin.
        GpioController gpio = GpioFactory.getInstance();
        ledPin = gpio.provisionDigitalOutputPin(RaspiPin.GPIO_01, "My LED", PinState.LOW);
    }

    public void turnOn() {
        // Turn the LED on by setting the pin to HIGH.
        ledPin.high();
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        // Turn the LED off by setting the pin to LOW.
        ledPin.low();
    }
}
```
In this example, we use the `GpioController` and `GpioPinDigitalOutput` classes from the Pi4J library to initialize the GPIO pin connected to the LED. We then implement the `turnOn()` and `turnOff()` methods by setting the pin to the appropriate state using the `high()` and `low()` methods of the `GpioPinDigitalOutput` class. Note that the pin number and other configuration parameters may vary depending on your specific hardware setup.
<br>

5. Build and package the bundle as a JAR file, using your preferred build tool such as Maven or Gradle. The resulting JAR file should contain the bundle's Java code and the manifest file. 
<br>

6. We need also to implement a bundle that provides a user interface for the device and uses the `LED` service to turn the LED on and off.
* * Define the bundle's manifest file:
```java
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
Bundle-Name: My IoT Bundle
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.example.iot.bundle
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Bundle-Activator: com.example.iot.bundle.Activator
Require-Bundle: org.osgi.core;bundle-version="1.9.0"
```
* * Define the bundle's Java code. In this example, we'll create a simple bundle that provides a user interface for the device, allowing the user to turn the LED on and off using a button. The bundle will use the LED service to control the LED. Here's an example Activator class that creates the user interface:
```java
package com.example.iot.ui.bundle;

import org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator;
import org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;
import org.osgi.framework.ServiceReference;

import com.example.iot.api.LED;

public class Activator implements BundleActivator {

    private LED led;

    public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        // Find the LED service and store a reference to it.
        ServiceReference<LED> ledRef = context.getServiceReference(LED.class);
        led = context.getService(ledRef);

        // Create the user interface and start it.
        MyUI ui = new MyUI(led);
        ui.start();
    }

    public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        // Stop the user interface and release the LED service reference.
        led = null;
    }
}
```
* * Define the user interface code. In this example, we'll create a simple user interface that displays a button for turning the LED on and off. The user interface will use the `LED` service to control the LED. Here's an example `MyUI` class that creates the user interface:
```java
package com.example.iot.ui.bundle;

import java.awt.BorderLayout;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JPanel;

import com.example.iot.api.LED;

public class MyUI {

    private LED led;

    public MyUI(LED led) {
        this.led = led;
    }

    public void start() {
        // Create the button and add an action listener to turn the LED on and off.
        JButton button = new JButton("Turn LED On/Off");
        button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                if (led != null) {
                    if (button.getText().equals("Turn LED On/Off")) {
                        led.turnOn();
                        button.setText("Turn LED Off");
                    } else {
                        led.turnOff();
                        button.setText("Turn LED On");
                    }
                }
            }
        });

        // Add the button to a panel and display the panel in a new frame.
        JPanel panel = new JPanel();
        panel.add(button);

        JFrame frame = new JFrame("My UI");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.getContentPane().add(panel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```
We create a `LEDControlUI` class that creates a simple UI with two buttons for turning the LED on and off. We use the `BundleContext` to get a reference to the LED service, and then add event listeners to the buttons that call the `turnOn()` and `turnOff()` methods of the `LED` service. 
<br>
Note that the UI code is implemented using the Swing library, but you could use any other UI framework that is compatible with OSGi.

<br>

<br>

<br>

It could be also implemented via an Angular component that provides a user interface for controlling the LED using the LED service:
```js
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { LED } from './led.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-led-control',
  template: `
    <div>
      <button (click)="turnOn()">Turn On</button>
      <button (click)="turnOff()">Turn Off</button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class LEDControlComponent implements OnInit {
  private ledService: LED;

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // Get a reference to the LED service.
    this.ledService = new LED();
  }

  turnOn() {
    // Call the LED service to turn the LED on.
    this.ledService.turnOn();
  }

  turnOff() {
    // Call the LED service to turn the LED off.
    this.ledService.turnOff();
  }
}
```
We create an `LEDControlComponent` that provides a simple UI with two buttons for turning the LED on and off. We use the LED service to control the `LED` by calling the `turnOn()` and `turnOff()` methods of the service when the user clicks the corresponding button. Note that the `LED` service is assumed to be implemented as a separate class with methods for controlling the LED, similar to the `MyLED` class we defined earlier.
<br>

To use this component, you would add it to an Angular application along with the `LED` service. You could then use Angular's dependency injection system to inject an instance of the `LED` service into the component, similar to how we initialize the service in the `ngOnInit` method of the component in this example. You could also use Angular's built-in event handling system to handle user input and call the appropriate methods of the `LED` service.

<br>

<br>

<br>

It could be also implemented for an Android app that provides a user interface for controlling the LED using the LED service:
```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

import com.example.myled.LED; // assuming the LED service is implemented in a separate package named "com.example.myled"

public class LEDControlActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private LED ledService;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_led_control);

        // Get a reference to the LED service.
        ledService = new LED();

        // Find the UI components.
        Button onButton = findViewById(R.id.btn_on);
        Button offButton = findViewById(R.id.btn_off);

        // Set up event listeners for the buttons.
        onButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Call the LED service to turn the LED on.
                ledService.turnOn();
            }
        });

        offButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Call the LED service to turn the LED off.
                ledService.turnOff();
            }
        });
    }
}
```
We create an `LEDControlActivity` that provides a simple UI with two buttons for turning the LED on and off. We use the `LED` service to control the LED by calling the `turnOn()` and `turnOff()` methods of the service when the user clicks the corresponding button. Note that the `LED` service is assumed to be implemented in a separate package named "com.example.myled" with methods for controlling the LED, similar to the `MyLED` class we defined earlier.
<br>

To use this activity, you would add it to an Android app along with the `LED` service package. You would also need to create a layout file named "activity_led_control.xml" that defines the UI for the activity, including the two buttons. You could then use the `setOnClickListener()` method of the `Button` class to handle user input and call the appropriate methods of the `LED` service. You would also need to ensure that the `com.example.myled` package is properly included in your app and that the `LED` service is registered and available for use.

<br>

<br>

<br>

7. Build and package the bundle as a JAR file, using your preferred build tool such as Maven or Gradle. The resulting JAR file should contain the bundle's Java code and the manifest file.
<br>

8. Install the bundles in the OSGi framework running on the IoT device, using the appropriate installation mechanism such as the OSGi console or a provisioning tool like Apache Karaf, along with the `MyLED` bundle that provides the `LED` service. When the `LEDControlUI` bundle starts, it will automatically register its UI components and start listening for user input. When the user clicks the "Turn On" or "Turn Off" button, the corresponding method of the `LED` service will be called to control the LED.

Once the bundle is installed and started, other bundles in the environment can use the LED service to control the device's LED. For example, a bundle that provides a user interface for the device could use the LED service to turn the LED on and off in response to user input.
